WavefunctionA (WF_A) is IN NEITHER state until it is ACTUALLY measured.  the moment WF_A it is measured, WF_B assumes the opposite spin with DEFINITE probability.  i understand that no information is transferred at a distance between WF_A and WF_B, but HOW does this happen.  WHAT is the mechanism that collapes WF_B into a definite spin state at a distance? I am not looking for explanations like \"satisfies laws of conservation\" ... instead i am looking for physical mechanism that allow this seemingly incredible phenomena to work.  If the \"weirdness\" i am describing is an artifact of the way i am asking the question (which is what i suspect), explainations there would be appreciated as well.',\n",

For example unrefined uranium, which is much less expensive, can be used instead of enriched uranium.',\n",

It spins so fast that metal valve springs can't keep, the springs are pneumatic.\\\\nBrakes- The better your brakes, the later you can brake and thus you can spend more time going fast.  These are carbon fiber and take 3 months to make.  They heat up to around 1500 F in use and can be seen glowing.  The wheels are limited to 13 inches in order to limit braking capability.  As they are, the driver experiences 4 G's of decelerating load under heavy braking.  An average person would black out in an F1 car.\\\\nAerodynamics- Surprisingly, drag is not the critical factor, downforce is.  These cars have very high coefficients of drag, due to the open wheels and spoilers.  The downforce is created by aero devices which are basically inverted aeroplane wings, which push the car to the ground under speed.  It is because of the dependence on these devices that F1 cars have a difficult time passing, once the cars enter the dirty air behind another racer, downforce drops dramatically and so does the car's ability to corner quickly.\\\\nTraction control- the cars generate so much power that the throttle is computer controlled to keep the tires from spinning.  The governing body (the FIA) wants to make this illegal but right now it is not feasible because it is merely software in the engine management systems, and it is not feasible to decompile these systems to find illegal code.\\\\nTransmisison- The cars utilize computer controlled sequential manual transmissions.  The computers manage the throttle and clutch to pull off perfect shifts in one tenth of a second.  All the driver does is pull a lever.  The clutch is only used from a standstill and is engaged from a lever on the steering wheel. \\\\nWhat doesn't make the cars fast-\\\\nTires- The tires are grooved to limit traction.  If the drivers were allowed to run slicks, the traction and G loading would be so high that drivers would black out and possibly crash.  Starting in 2005, they also must last the entire race.\\\\nWheels- Size limited to prevent the installation of overlarge brakes which would also push the drivers beyond the limits of human physiology\\\\nBrakes- As stated earlier, size limited.

There are materials that will glow for a long time due to radioactive decay or via chemical processes, but all of these are using up their 'fuel' in the process and will eventually run out.\\\\nSome radioactive substances have a pretty long half-life and will appear to glow steadily without much decay over the scale of a human lifetime.\\\\nNow, to get more generalized... it is possible to trap light in a container that doesn't shine. Scientists have been able to free light in its place using supercooled clouds of sodium which are naturally opaque, but can temporarily transmit light when altered via a laser beam.  If the laser is shut off, a light beam that is passing through the cloud will be temporarily frozen in place.  Australian scientists have recently been able to extend this interaction to be nearly as long as a second.\\\\nOnce the laser is reintroduced the beam is recovered and continues on its way.  Now all this is a little debatable, since the photons actually get temporarily swallowed up by the material.

Many of these new buildings were taller than anything ever built before and most had elevators. As buildings got taller and taller, more people began to use elevators. Elevators in those days were pretty darn slow. People were constantly complaining about how slow the elevators were. \\\\n\\\\nElevator companies were challenged with this problem and came up with the typical problem statement elevators move too slow. So they went off to design elevators that were faster and safer, but at the time it was very expensive to do so. Several companies went off and running to build a safer and faster elevator, and one elevator company proposed a different problem statement. They may have had a different name for the approach, but they were using the fundamentals of the �est problem statement tool. One engineer said, I think our elevator speeds are just fine, people are crazy. \\\\n\\\\nThen an engineer proposed that they work on a different problem statement. He proposed that the problem was people think elevators move to slow. He inserted two words people think into the problem statement which allowed the design team to approach the problem from a completely different angle and thus a whole new set of ideas. Instead of concentrating on larger motors, slicker pulley designs and such, they concentrated on the passenger in the elevator.\\\\n\\\\nWhen they looked at the problem from this angle, the ideas started to snowball. Is it really too slow? Why do they think it is slow? How can we distract them? How can we make it more comfortable? Are customers scared of heights?\\\\n\\\\nThis lead to some first hand customer research. They found that a lot of people thought the elevators were a lot slower then they actually were. \\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThey also discovered that people had an exaggerated sense of time because they had nothing to do but stare at the wall and think about the safety of the elevator  being suspended in the air, and preoccupied with the fear of falling. \\\\n\\\\nt room for additional equipment of any sort, so they brainstormed on that. This lead to the idea of mirrors in elevators so people would think about something else besides danger. Was their hair combed properly? Did her makeup look okay?\\\\n\\\\nBy installing mirrors in the elevators, people became distracted and were no longer preoccupied with the fear of falling. On a follow up survey, customers commented how much faster the new elevators were even though the speed was exactly the same. The elevator design itself had not changed at all.\" \\\\n\\\\n',\n",

So to answer what's driving human evolution you need to look at the human environment as part of the equation. Extreme evolution happens when an organism's environment changes and it cannot escape it. As a previous post mentioned, humans now have the ability to easily move around the world and escape a 'bad' environment. So evolution may indeed have slowed, but it is not dead. Some cataclysmic change affecting the whole planet, if it doesn't kill the species completely, will certainly speed up the evolutionary process when you compare the human race a few generations either side of said event.\\\\n\\\\nGiven that evolution is the result of genetic mutation/favoritism during sexual reproduction are we seeing those more desirable for sex setting the evolutionary path while environment change is minimized by our ability to control it or escape it?\\\\n\\\\nIs average height an example of this?

The very high voltage there is stepped down using a transformer to supply most houses and businesses with a usable lower voltage.  The voltage between any one of the three wires to ground in a house is 110 Volts for example to light a light bulb.  The voltage between any two wires is 220 Volts and is used for example to power a clothes dryer or kitchen range.  Houses do not use all three wires.  A machine shop may power a large motor by connecting all three wires (in a delta or Y configuration) to obtain 440 Volts.  Therefore the progression of 110, 220, and 440 Volts stems from the use of single, two and three-phase wiring circuits.  Electrical power is conducted cross-country at very high voltages using high tension lines strung in sets of three wires or phases which produces the multiple of 11 you mention.

The 30 is a little too short for most hilly rides, and basically you're spinning super fast to get up a hill.

Knee to knee, and eye to eye. Be sure to hold hands and feed each other. Talk about 'the time when we...' or 'that one time when we...'. Before you know it, hours will have passed. Don't be afraid to sip a little more wine than what you normally do. You'll soon find yourself maybe getting a little frisky. \\\\n\\\\nBut before you go any further, grab that piece of paper and pen, and write down a few lines about what that other person means to you. How they make you feel, and why you love them. Why you appreciate them. The more specific you get the better. For example, I love my man more everytime I catch him acting like a little kid when he thinks no one is around. Now don't let the other person read it. Seal it in the envelope, and save it for your next anniversary. It's so fun, and gives you something really fantastic to look forward to. \\\\n\\\\nNow would be a good time to finish off the night with a long kiss...and maybe more.\\\\n\\\\nYou've just created a wonderful memory of the two of you together, sincerely enjoying each other.\\\\n\\\\nMuch better than some boring evening at an overpriced restaurant where nobody talked to each other, don't you think?\",\n",

The eastern Cherokee still maintain their reservation in western North Carolina. The Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory has almost 12,000 members and has been recognized by the State of Missouri. Other groups of Cherokee, like the 2,500 members of the North Alabama Cherokee, are located in Arkansas, Georgia, and Alabama but currently do not have federal recognition.\\\\n\\\\nPopulation\\\\nEuropean epidemics introduced into the southeastern United States in 1540 by the Desoto expedition are estimated to have killed at least 75% of the original native population. How much the Cherokee suffered from this disaster in unknown, but their population in 1674 was about 50,000. A series of smallpox epidemics (1729, 1738, and 1753) cut this in half, and it remained fairly stable at about 25,000 until their removal to Oklahoma during the 1830s. The American Civil War was the next disaster and cost the Cherokee 25% of their population. No other group of Americans, red or white, suffered as severely during this conflict. The 1990 census listed 308,132 persons (15,000 full-blood) who identified themselves as Cherokee. Of these, 95,435 were concentrated in eastern Oklahoma while 10,114 eastern Cherokee lived on or near the North Carolina reservation. Cherokee tribal governments have fairly liberal membership standards, and some estimates exceed 370,000, which would make the Cherokee the largest Native American group in the United States.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nName\\\\nThe most familiar name, Cherokee, comes from a Creek word \"Chelokee\" meaning \"people of a different speech.\" In their own language the Cherokee originally called themselves the Aniyunwiya (or Anniyaya) \"principal people\" or the Keetoowah (or Anikituaghi, Anikituhwagi) \"people of Kituhwa.\" Although they usually accept being called Cherokee, many prefer Tsalagi from their own name for the Cherokee Nation (Tsalagihi Ayili). Other names applied to the Cherokee have been: Allegheny (or Allegewi, Talligewi) (Delaware), Baniatho (Arapaho), Caáxi (or Cayaki) (Osage and Kansa), Chalaque (Spanish), Chilukki (dog people) (Choctaw and Chickasaw), Entarironnen (mountain people) (Huron), Gatohuá (Creek), Kittuwa (or Katowá) (Algonquin), Matera (or Manteran) (coming out of the ground) ( Catawba), Nation du Chien (French), Ochietarironnon (Wyandot), Oyatageronon (or Oyaudah, Uwatayoronon) (cave people) (Iroquois), Shanaki (Caddo), Shannakiak (Fox), Tcaike (Tonkawa), and Tcerokieco (Wichita).\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nLanguage\\\\nIroquian, but Cherokee differs significantly from other Iroquian languages.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nSub-tribes\\\\n\\\\nThe Cherokee have been divided into three divisions depending on location and dialect (east to west): \\\\nLower',\n",

Trace IP addresses back to users.  Remember, the businesses involved all have to keep records.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, some programs embed identifying information in them.\\\\n\\\\nPretty much any Microsoft program, at least one that uses OLE Structured Storage, creates these huge ID numbers in them called a GUID for each item in the file.  Part of that ID number is their IP address or the unique hardware ID of their interface card, I forget which.\\\\n\\\\nAlso, the encoding process which generates an MP3 file from a CD can store some information in the file which can be used to piece together who created it. It may not be enough to find who did it but it is probably helpful in proving a given computer did it once they have that computer.\\\\n\\\\nThere is probably more going on but you get the idea. At each point along the way, from creating the song file, to transfering it to a service, and downloading it from a service, bits of information are accumulating.\\\\n\\\\nThe more times a person does each of these things, the easier it is to find them, prove it is them, and notice that they are doing a lot.

Proponents and analysts attribute this success to its vendor independence (the opposite of vendor lock-in), low cost, security, and reliability.\\\\n\\\\nLinux was originally developed for Intel 386 microprocessors and now supports all popular computer architectures (and several obscure ones). It is deployed in applications ranging from embedded systems (such as mobile phones and personal video recorders) to personal computers to supercomputers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTo know much more about linux Read the very good article\\\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINUX\",\n",

If you ask the person a normal question, like \"do you have any change for the toll?\" and they start screaming that \"all you do is harp about money,\" you\\'ve got a problem.

This is usually disguised as jealousy which women may think lattering -- at first.  Don\\'t be fooled.  Control freaks also don\\'t want you to hold a job or have any money of your own.  You must beg for an \"allowance.\"\\\\n\\\\nFinancial:  There are a lot of men who live off women.  They have jobs when you meet them.  Then, something happens, and it\\'s always the company or bosses fault.  They tell you they\\'re out job hunting, but nothing is happening.  Next comes laying around on the couch all day, sleeping, watching tv or guzzling beer.  Weeks turn into months and it\\'s just you working.  Or, the person flits from job to job and can\\'t hold a job.  This man will plunge you right into financial ruin and guess what -- you can\\'t get them out of the house all that easy, if it happens to be your house and not a joint home.

Common misunderstandings surround their name origin, removal reasons and\\\\npain sources, according to the Academy of General Dentistry, an organization of\\\\ngeneral dentists dedicated to continuing education. \\\\n\\\\n\"The name \\'wisdom teeth\\' is age related - third molars don\\'t erupt until teenage\\\\nyears and beyond, when people theoretically are more wise to the world,\" says Trey\\\\nPetty, DDS, FAGD, spokesperson for the Academy of General Dentistry.\\\\n\\\\nCommon reasons for wisdom teeth removal include impaction, pain and crowding of the\\\\nother teeth, which are typical tooth growth characteristics.\\\\n\\\\n\"If wisdom teeth are not visible, they are impacted or unable to erupt due to space\\\\nand size limitations,\" says Dr. Petty. \"Impacted teeth don\\'t have enough room to grow,\\\\nand will lay beneath the gums, which may or may not be a problem.\" \\\\n\\\\nPain and tooth crowding are also top wisdom teeth problems. \"Adults have forgotten\\\\nwhat normal pain from a growing tooth feels like,\" says Dr. Petty. Complications also\\\\ncan arise when wisdom teeth partially erupt. The broken gum acts as a breeding ground\\\\nfor bacteria and germs. \\\\n\\\\n\"When wisdom teeth partially erupt, food gets caught in the gums and may cause an\\\\ninfection, swelling, growth of a tumor or cyst and pain,\" says Dr. Petty. \"If this\\\\nhappens, consult a dentist before problems worsen and affect overall oral health.\"\\\\n\\\\n\"If wisdom teeth have erupted, the key to preserving them is maintaining good oral\\\\nhealth by brushing twice a day and going to see a dentist twice a year,\" says\\\\nDr. Petty.',\n",

       "  555: 'Allow me to answer this question because I AM on the top #1 spot in three different categories (first names, nursery rhymes, blonde jokes).\\\\n\\\\nCONTENT -- \\\\nFirst and foremost, the content you have on your site is the most important and most crucial thing over anyting else that you can do to your site. What I advise my clients to do is to actually THINK like a search engine or if that is too abstract, think like someone who speaks a different language. \\\\n\\\\nAlthough search engines are getting much better at figuring out exactly what it is that is on the page, remember it is often impossible for them to decipher Java, Javascript, Flash, and other non-HTML components. This is NOT to say don\\'t use them, just use them when they are to be used appropriately.\\\\n\\\\nBecause search engines ARE getting better at figuring out what is on a page, spelling and grammar are also very important. The rule of thumb is no more than three misspellings and no more than three gramatical errors on a page. Sentences should be of short to medium length and paragraphs should also be rather short.\\\\n\\\\nDO NOT COPY OTHER PEOPLE\\'S WORK. The search engines can penalize a site heavily for plagiarism.\\\\n\\\\nTAGS\\\\n\\\\nTitle Tags -- The most important of all tags is the Title tag. This is what shows up on the bars on the bottom of your computer screen. Most people make the mistake of putting their company name in the Title Tag and that is the worst thing to do (other than putting no tag at all). A Title Tag should be short and to the point and tell what the page is about and if you want to add your company name then add it at the END of the title tag not at the beginning.\\\\n\\\\nMeta Tags -- Meta tags were how search engines would know what was on a page... many years ago. However, with that said it is important that Meta tags are still added to your site and more importantly there are new meta tags (more than just description and keywords) that should be added to the web site such as content type and content language.\\\\n\\\\nMeta Description -- Meta description should start out with the SAME thing your TITLE tag says and then go into more detail. \\\\n\\\\nMeta Keywords -- Meta keywords are words used to describe what is in your page. First use keywords that are in the title and the description first. Then use keywords that are in the content of the page. DO NOT try to spam the search engines by using keywords that are not relevant to your content.\\\\n\\\\nAlt Tags -- With the advent of XHTML, ALT tags for images are now REQUIRED. The Alt tag is used for people who have their images turned off so it is important to have in the alt tag exactly what the image is but also expand on what it is. An example would be a HOME button. Instead of just having HOME as the Alt Tag, use Home -- Site Name.com. \\\\n\\\\nI have noticed that search engines love geography and it is good to put that in there whenever appropriate. If your company is in Kansas City, MO then put those in the Content and in the Tags.\\\\n\\\\nLINKS\\\\n\\\\nHaving links that send people to sites relevant to your site is always a good practice. People ask me where I get links and how do I get people to link to my site. The answer is very simple. First I ask. I write e-mails (NOT SPAM) to sites asking if they wish to reciprocate links with me and I also have on some of my pages a \"Link to this Page\" button so that web site owners can do it on their own.\\\\n\\\\nThere is great debate as to whether links to other sites that are not of the same category help, hurt, or are indifferent. From my ten years experience I have found that appropriate links DO NOT hurt your web site and could very well help in some instances.\\\\n\\\\nPRIVACY POLICY\\\\n\\\\nI won\\'t go into much detail here but make sure you have one. So many people forget this and it is extremely important. You will NOT find a major web page that does not have a Privacy Policy attached to it.\\\\n\\\\nTRAFFIC\\\\n\\\\nObviously the more traffic you have coming to your web site the better.

Writing in a special review of sleep in the current issue of Nature, Dr Siegel says that it may be related to defence against oxidative stress. Smaller animals have higher metabolic rates, and this results in the generation of higher levels of small, highly reactive molecules such as free radicals. Studies on rats show that when they are deprived of sleep, their oxidative stress increases. Dr Siegel proposes that animals with higher metabolic rates need more sleep to interrupt and protect against this kind of oxidative damage, as well as repairing any damage done.',\n",

It\\'s also pretty wide - wider than her old tower by 2-3 inches.  \\\\n\\\\nBecause my client wanted several measures of reliability and backup, we had the system preconfigured with a mirrored RAID array (2x250GB HDs), a DVD+/-RW drive for ad hoc backups, and an external harddrive for scheduled backups that can backup the entire drive.  Since she also wanted to be able to do graphics editing in the future, we got the machine with a GeForce 6800 graphics card (leaving open the option to add a second card in SLI configuration at a later date, if needed, though if they\\'d offered the option earlier, I would have recommended the 7800 GTX) and got a good 5.1 sound card installed as well (hooked up to old speakers, but WTF - it\\'s her money) and 2GB RAM, with room to go up to 4GB if needed.\\\\n\\\\nFor external expansion, it comes with 8 USB 2.0 ports, and 3(?) firewire ports.  6 of the USB ports are in the back, with 2 firewire, while 3 are in front, behind a small panel.  We actually used most of the USB ports while setting up most of her peripherals, but you can always add a USB 2.0 high speed hub if you have that many additional devices.    If you have older keyboards and/or mice you\\'re fond of that are PS/2, the machine does have ports for those as well.   (My client is still using a 10-year old keyboard from her old 486 PC that ran Windows 95.  I think it\\'s Dorian Grey\\'s keyboard, and has a printout of itself aging in a closet somewhere.)  If you have an old parallel printer though, it does NOT have a parallel port, so you\\'ll need a parallel to USB cable or you\\'ll need to order a parallel port card.\\\\n\\\\nFrom a software standpoint, the machine is very nice to use - everything runs very smoothly (in part thanks to the dual core CPU) with the only hiccup being AOL, which was preinstalled, but still has problems even in version 9.0 with playing well with Internet Explorer, since AOL uses the IE kernel for its own browsing component - running the two at the same time caused problems.\\\\n\\\\nAll in old, I\\'d say this is an excellent PC, competitive with other high end PCs from boutique manufacturers.  Where it falls short is the ability to get Dell on the phone - even with \"a separate queue just for XPS users\", we were on hold for close to an hour without ever speaking with a representative when trying to find out whether the shipped PC actually matched the original specs fro when the PC was ordered through the website.  Smaller PC vendors, such as Falcon-Northwest, VoodooPC, Monarch, and ABS are much better about being responsive to customers after the sale than Dell was here.

See wers- in Indo-European Roots.] \\\\nWord History: The chaos of war is reflected in the semantic history of the word war. War can be traced back to the Indo-European root *wers-, “to confuse, mix up.” In the Germanic family of the Indo-European languages, this root gave rise to several words having to do with confusion or mixture of various kinds. One was the noun *werza-, “confusion,” which in a later form *werra- was borrowed into Old French, probably from Frankish, a largely unrecorded Germanic language that contributed about 200 words to the vocabulary of Old French. From the Germanic stem came both the form werre in Old North French, the form borrowed into English in the 12th century, and guerre (the source of guerrilla) in the rest of the Old French-speaking area. Both forms meant “war.” Meanwhile another form derived from the same Indo-European root had developed into a word denoting a more benign kind of mixture, Old High German wurst, meaning “sausage.” Modern German Wurst was borrowed into English in the 19th century, first by itself (recorded in 1855) and then as part of the word liverwurst (1869), the liver being a translation of German Leber in Leberwurst.',\n",

I didn't start taking medications until 2004 (had a bit of denial there)...\\\\nI got a flare-up that forced me to think harder about my future (and a great fiance to boot!).\\\\n\\\\nA lot of people go on the interferons, and Glatiramer acetate, which is what I'm on.  When I decided what to go on, I thought about what I'd have to do for it.  I was a bit worried about giving myself a shot, and I figured that I would need to have the least intrusive method of medication delivery... so I decided subcutaneous (just under the skin).  That cut down the list of interferons... \\\\n\\\\nThen I thought about side effects, a lot of the interferons have flu like symptoms.  When I started the meds, I was feeling weak, pins and needly, and limpy.  I said, do I want to have a cold on top of that.  No siree.\\\\n\\\\nI mean, you really have to talk to your NEURO, and what (s)he recommends.  It just so happened that the first NEURO in 1999, recommended Avonex as he was drinking out of an Avonex branded mug (no foolin!).  That is what turned me off from the med idea in the first place.  My SECOND neuro, he asked me my concerns, and we decided on Copaxone.  Yes, it's daily, but it's under the skin, and it just has local reactions for me as a side effect.\\\\n\\\\nI WAS PETRIFIED of giving myself these shots.  Many of the companies (my drugs, included) have autojectors, so you don't even have to see the needle.  Copaxone (or my doctor, I can't remember, it was so long ago!)... required me to have a home care nurse there the first time to show me how to administer the drugs.  I gave it to myself without hesitation the first time!  I am a little wary of someone else doing it (though she had recommended that my fiance learn how, too).\\\\n\\\\nResult?  Well, there's not much to say!  (that's a good thing)... my original symptoms had faded, and I don't know if that was the copaxone or what.

       "  645: \"The sky appears blue because the gases(mainly nitrogen and oxygen) present in our atmosphere vibrate at a specific frequency.  From the light that we can see, ie.. blue, green, red, yellow...etc, the the higher frequency colors are absorbed more by the atmosphere than the lower frequency(actually they're scattered, they still make it to us but indirectly whereas the yellowish color of the sun is more direct).  So blue, green, and violet(violet having the shortest wavelength) are absorbed by the atmosphere, while red, yellow and orange are allowed through.   The color of blue that we perceive the sky varies from day to day based on the content of gases present and the frequency that they vibrate.

As such, the crew was directed to make sure the first and second class passengers were attended to first.

Sharing in the blame would have to be the officer who tried to turn the ship when it was too close already, since the ship wouldn\\'t have sunk if it hit the iceberg head on. It was also the captain\\'s fault for not taking the necessary precautions with the ship when he knew they were headed directly into an ice field.\\\\n\\\\n(4) The shipbuilders wanted as much \"ooh and ahh\" over the ship as they could get from the public. That\\'s why they fostered the belief that the ship was \"unsinkable\", and that the ship itself was one big lifeboat. Those in charge also felt that the extra boats would have cluttered up the ship\\'s deck. \\\\n\\\\n(5) They didn\\'t prepare for this because they were arrogant and felt that they had the greatest ship in all of history and nothing would ever happen to it.\\\\n\\\\n(6) Greed is why people tried to take and sell Titanic artifacts.

The Parthenon is a Doric peripteral temple, which means that it consists of a rectangular floor plan with a series of low steps on every side, and a colonnade (8 x 17) of Doric columns extending around the periphery of the entire structure. Each entrance has an additional six columns in front of it. The larger of the two interior rooms, the naos, housed the cult statue. The smaller room (the opisthodomos) was used as a treasury.\\\\n\\\\nSome historians believe that Athens concluded a peace treaty with Persia in 449, two years before work began on the Parthenon. The significance of this would be that the Delian League/Athenian Empire continued to exist, even after the reason for its existence (a mutual defense league against the Persians) had ceased to be valid. In other words it was now openly acknowledged that Athens was not just the head of the Greek defense league but actually an imperial master over other Greek states. The decision by the Athenians in 454 BC to move the League treasury from the Panhellenic sanctuary at Delos to the Athenian acropolis points in the same direction. Because the Parthenon was built with League funds, the building may be read as an expression of the confidence of the Athenians in this newly naked imperialism.',\n",

The name \"chaos theory\" comes from the fact that the systems that the theory describes are apparently disordered, but chaos theory is really about finding the underlying order in apparently random data. \\\\nWhen was chaos first discovered? The first true experimenter in chaos was a meteorologist, named Edward Lorenz. In 1960, he was working on the problem of weather prediction. He had a computer set up, with a set of twelve equations to model the weather. It didn\\'t predict the weather itself. However this computer program did theoretically predict what the weather might be. \\\\n\\\\nOne day in 1961, he wanted to see a particular sequence again. To save time, he started in the middle of the sequence, instead of the beginning. He entered the number off his printout and left to let it run. \\\\n\\\\nWhen he came back an hour later, the sequence had evolved differently. Instead of the same pattern as before, it diverged from the pattern, ending up wildly different from the original. (See figure 1.) Eventually he figured out what happened. The computer stored the numbers to six decimal places in its memory. To save paper, he only had it print out three decimal places. In the original sequence, the number was .506127, and he had only typed the first three digits, .506.   ...(c this site)',\n",

If we look at the ICC ODI Ranking Table then we would see that Australia is 1st and way ahead. But competition is strict from 2nd to 7th as South Africa is marginally ahead of Pakistan who is followed by India, England, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand. This shows how close these teams are when it comes to their standard of play and their consistency. It also means that from 2nd to 7th Position any team can beat its opponent (Even Australia, As New Zealand has just proved it by beating Australia in a record chase). So I think any of the Top Seven teams can won the World Cup on its day. Now a days ODI cricket has become so unpredictable that any thing can happen. \\\\n\\\\nComing back to the question, I would say that Aussies are favorites to defend their title but a bad day can stop their march towards a dream hat trick. Apart from Australia, every other team (i.e.; England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, South Africa) have equal chance to win the WC 2007. Any of the above mentioned team can make Aussies pay for their mistakes on the certain day. So, I would say that, India has equal chance of winning the World Cup 2007 as any other Top 7 team, with Aussies being the Favorites.\",\n",

Ham radio also had logs called \"glogs\" that were personal diaries made using wearable computers in the early 1980s.\\\\n    * Before blogging became popular, digital communities took many forms, including Usenet, e-mail lists and bulletin boards.

As many people know it is certainly not as important of a holiday as Passover, Yom Kippur, Shavuot, and other Jewish holidays. Most of the over-importance heaped on Hanukkah is due to its timing when comparing the Hebrew calendar to the Roman calendar. I personally find it ironic that the 25th of Kislev (the Hebrew calendar date for the first night of Hanukkah) is associated with the 25th of December (the Roman calendar date for the observance of Christmas). \\\\n\\\\nSo on to your specific question. There is no good answer why Christians do not celebrate Hanukkah. In the spirit of global tolerance and of coming together Christians may want to light a menorah to usher in the holiday time. After all there are an increasing number of Christians that celebrate the Passover holiday; even if it is likened to Christ's Last Supper which was undoubtably a Seder. \\\\n\\\\nOne of the most poignant discussions on the significance and relevance of Hanukkah to Christians is from Reverend Ricky Hoyt.

The undeniable evidence is that anger, anxiety and depression, on one hand, and love and intimacy on the other, affect health and recovery from illness. This findings have been elaborated by Dean Ornish MD in Love and Survival. The Scientific Basis for the Healing Power of Intimacy. (1997)  He writes: \\\\n\\\\n“…love and intimacy are at the root of what makes us sick and what makes us well... I am not aware of any factor in medicine -- not diet, not smoking, not stress, not genetics, not drugs, not surgery—that has greater  impact on our quality of life, incidence of illness and premature death from all causes.” \\\\n\\\\nYet, caring (love to be blunt,) which is presumed to be based on a mammalian instinct, strongly allied with survival is fraught with difficulties and is becoming increasingly difficult to exercise in our culture. Hoping to counteract these trends, I endeavor to teach people the simple, basic transactions that constitute the loving experience. This practice is based on three concepts: Strokes, The Stroke Economy and Opening the Heart. \\\\n\\\\nPuzzled by the difficulties that people have when exchanging strokes I came upon Wilhelm Reich’s concept of the \"sex economy,\" which he defined as the intentional squelching of sexual exchanges among German youth for the purpose of promoting conformity. I saw a similar inhibiting trend in our culture, applied to simple affection and love, and called it the \"stroke economy.\"\\\\n\\\\nThe stroke economy creates a scarcity of love and affection by imposing a set of rules that govern the exchange of strokes. \\\\n\\\\nThe rules of the stroke economy are:\\\\n\\\\nDon’t give strokes you would like to give.\\\\n\\\\nDon’t ask for strokes you would like to get. \\\\n\\\\nDon’t accept strokes you would like to accept.\\\\n\\\\nDon’t reject strokes you don’t want.\\\\n\\\\nDon’t give yourself strokes.\\\\n\\\\nThese rules are enforced internally and externally. Internally, by what we, in transactional analysis, call the inner Critical Parent. The Critical Parent is an ego state and as such it represents a network of ideas, acquired in childhood which deeply affect love of ourselves and others. These ideas can be seen as ingrained neural networks; \"limbic attractors\" that shape every emotional experience according to an archaic blueprint.\\\\n\\\\nWhile loving patterns are set in childhood, later relationships in which the person establishes a limbic resonance with another are capable of restructuring  the original design. Lewis et al conclude that permanent beneficial restructuring of a persons deeply ingrained limbic brain patterns is possible through long-term individual psychotherapy with a therapist who, for all intents and purposes, needs to be a paragon of limbic virtue.',\n",

Current is like the flow of water in a pipe and voltage is like the pressure causing the water to flow.  If you use the water to drive a hydraulic piston (say to hoist an automobile for repair) you can use either a small piston and high pressure or a larger piston and lower pressure.  Which is more cost effective?\\\\n\\\\nIn the United States, electric power is delivered to neighborhoods using three wires (three phases) strung along telephone (power) poles.  Only two of the wires are led to a single residence but the neighborhood must use all three wires to balance load on the wires.  Within a house electricity passes from only one wire (phase) to ground or earth to light a lightbulb which uses 110 volts.  The clothes dryer that needs far more power is connected between two of the supply wires (two phase) and to ground to supply 220 volts.  A machine shop might connect a very large motor to all three supply wires to obtain even more power at 440 volts.\\\\n\\\\nSix volts or even 12 volts DC in an automobile circuit can be touched with little danger.  It is less dangerous to accidentally touch a 110 volt AC wire than a 220 volt source and 440 volts is most dangerous.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, the selection of voltage depends in part on safety and then on the size of the job to be tackled and also economic factors.  The higher the required current, the larger the required wires using expensive copper.  Increasing the voltage reduces the needed current and reduces the needed copper to do a given job.  The higher the required voltage, the more expensive the required electrical insulation will be.  Engineers must determine the best trade off of many factors.',\n",

Wealthy local landowner Lord Parham had the area drained in 1803 and the village that sprung up in this area became known as Gnat's Cross.

Contrary to much popular belief, these are not the twelve days before Christmas, but in most of the Western Church are the twelve days from Christmas until the beginning of Epiphany  (January 6th; the 12 days count from December 25th until January 5th). In some traditions, the first day of Christmas begins on the evening of December 25th but the following day is considered the First Day of Christmas (December 26th).\\\\n\\\\nThe origin of the Twelve Days is complicated, and is related to differences in calendars, church traditions, and ways to observe this holy day in various cultures (see Christmas).  In the Western church, Epiphany is traditionally celebrated as the time the three Wise Men or Magi arrived to present gifts to the young Jesus (Matt. 2:1-12). In some cultures, especially Hispanic and Latin American culture, January 6th is observed as Three Kings Day, or simply the Day of the Kings (Span: la Fiesta de Reyes, el Dia de los Tres Reyes, or el Dia de los Reyes Magos; Dutch: Driekoningendag).  Even though December 25th is celebrated as Christmas in these cultures, January 6th is often the day for giving gifts. In some places it is traditional to give Christmas gifts for each of the Twelve Days of Christmas. Since Eastern Orthodox traditions use a different religious calendar, they celebrate Christmas on January 7th and observe Epiphany or Theophany on January 19th.\\\\n\\\\nBy the 16th century, some European and Scandinavian cultures had combined the Twelve Days of Christmas with (sometimes pagan) festivals celebrating the changing of the year. These were usually associated with driving away evil spirits for the start of the new year. \\\\n\\\\nThe Twelfth Night is January 5th, the last day of the Christmas Season before Epiphany (January 6th). In some church traditions, January 5th is considered the eleventh Day of Christmas, while the evening of January 5th is still counted as the Twelfth Night, the beginning of the Twelfth day of Christmas the following day.  Twelfth Night often included feasting along with the removal of Christmas decorations. French and English celebrations of Twelfth Night included a King\\'s Cake, remembering the visit of the Three Magi, and ale or wine (a King\\'s Cake is part of the observance of Mardi Gras in French Catholic culture of the Southern USA).  In some cultures, the King\\'s Cake was part of the celebration of the day of Epiphany. \\\\n\\\\nThe popular song \"The Twelve Days of Christmas\" is usually seen as simply a nonsense song for children. However, some have suggested that it is a song of Christian instruction dating to the 16th century religious wars in England, with hidden references to the basic teachings of the Faith.  They contend that it was a mnemonic device to teach the catechism to youngsters. The \"true love\" mentioned in the song is not an earthly suitor, but refers to God Himself. The \"me\" who receives the presents refers to every baptized person who is part of the Christian Faith. Each of the \"days\" represents some aspect of the Christian Faith that was important for children to learn.\\\\n\\\\nHowever, many have questioned the historical accuracy of this origin of the song The Twelve Days of Christmas.  It seems that some have made an issue out of trying to debunk this as an \"urban myth,\" some in the name of historical accuracy and some out of personal agendas.  There is little \"hard\" evidence available either way.  Some church historians affirm this account as basically accurate, while others point out apparent historical discrepancies. However, the \"evidence\" on both sides is mostly in logical deduction and probabilities.  One internet site devoted to debunking hoaxes and legends says that, \"there is no substantive evidence to demonstrate that the song \\'Th',\n",

It is a property of the electromagnetic field when this field is undergoing changes. from its point of origin, this field radiates out into space in all directions. It is invisible, but can be felt by charged particles. When this field is changed, for instance by suddenly altering the position of its emitter, a kink develops in the field which propagates out into space at the speed of light. Under the right circumstances of acceleration, this kink becomes electromagnetic radiation - light. So space simply acts as a passive container for the electromagnetic field, which in turn is the 'medium' in which light exists.\",\n",
